# Evaluation Criteria for our Research

The evaluation criteria for our research are published in this repo and will be used in all our research reports evaluating vendors.

If you feel the list is missing something or needs to be changed, we encourage you to create an issue for discussion. After discussion, a pull request may be created to implement the addition or change.

We expect both vendors and end users to contribute to this repo so that the criteria published here will serve as a blueprint for end users wanting to evaluate various vendor products.

We are in the initial stages of bringing openness to enterprise market research and our strategy will evolve over time towards more openness.
